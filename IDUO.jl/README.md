This is a Julia implementation of the Incremental Dictionary Learning with Sparsity by Azimi-Sadjadi, Zhao, Sheedvash

USPS dataset used in testing can be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/4pn9kty1kw8dl67/AADa7YshuXCtW5ouYxcc-Rnpa?dl=0

This dataset has been altered slightly from the original USPS, making it more suitable for this test. In particular, the samples were re-sampled and zero padding was added to the edges of the images so that the format matched MNIST zero-padding spec.
